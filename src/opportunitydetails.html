            Kenya is renowned for its abundant wildlife that freely roams the savanna, playing a significant role in the country’s economy, including at the grassroots level. Unfortunately, many remote communities live in close proximity to wildlife, leading to human-wildlife conflicts that displace animals from their natural habitat. To promote a healthy co-existence between wildlife and local communities, various organizations have established conservancy areas. As a participant in this program, you will work closely with our conservationist to support the conservation efforts’ objectives.
            <br>
            Your activities will include ecological monitoring, conducting censuses, tracking wildlife, and collaring among other activities. Throughout your work at the conservation site, you will be accompanied by a wildlife specialist who will guide you through your schedule and train you on the activities. Importantly, a local community resides within the conservancy, and meaningful interactions with the locals will help you understand their co-existence with wildlife and the impact of conservation efforts.
